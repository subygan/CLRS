Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

1. finding the most recent transaction would require sorting of some sort

Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

memory, cache

----------------------------------------

Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

Dictionary is an amazing data structure because the fetch operation is O(1).
But, it doesn't have the values sorted and requires a key, which is kinda bad in some algorithms

1.1-4
How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

Shortest path goes from point A to B
traveling-salesman goes from point A and reaches certain nodes and comes back
they are similar in that they both are path finding algorithms.
