#### 4.1-1
What does FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY return when all elements of A are negative?

#### 4.1-2
Write pseudocode for the brute-force method of solving the maximum-subarray problem. Your procedure should run in O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.

#### 4.1-3
Implement both the brute-force and recursive algorithms for the maximum- subarray problem on your own computer. What problem size n0 gives the crossover point at which the recursive algorithm beats the brute-force algorithm? Then, change the base case of the recursive algorithm to use the brute-force algorithm whenever the problem size is less than n0. Does that change the crossover point?
4.1-4
Suppose we change the definition of the maximum-subarray problem to allow the result to be an empty subarray, where the sum of the values of an empty subar-
