## The maximum subarray problem

you are given a list of stock prices for everyday, and you are asked to guess 
the best day to buy and sell. 

##### note:
 - it is not as easy as just checking the highest and lowest value and 
   predicting the value. because __the highest day can come after the 
   lowest day__    
 - You are having to find the max difference in buying and selling 


### Methods:

- Brute force method 
    - Try every possibility 
    - Ω(n<sup>2</sup>)
    
- Transformed
    - convert the given range of n values into a difference between, n and 
      n+1
    - This transformation can be optimised that the computations are not  re done.
    Thus, making it a little more efficient.
      
      
- Divide and conquer
    - Θ(n log n)
    - 3 places the solution can be present,
        - entirely in the subarray A\[low, .... mid\]
        - entirely in the subarray A\[mid+1, .... ,high\]
        - crossing the midpoint, so that low ≤ i ≤  mid < j ≤ high.
