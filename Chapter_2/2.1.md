2.1-1
Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array A D h31; 41; 59; 26; 41; 58i.

------------------------------------------------

2.1-2
Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of non- decreasing order.


------------------------------------------------

2.1-3
Consider the searching problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers A D ha1;a2;:::;ani and a value 􏰂.
Output: An index i such that 􏰂 D AŒi􏰁 or the special value NIL if 􏰂 does not
appear in A.
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for 􏰂. Using a loop invariant, prove that
your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

-----------------------------------------------

2.1-4
Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B. The sum of the two
integers should be stored in binary form in an .n C 1/-element array C . State the problem formally and write pseudocode
for adding the two integers.
